## Why do we need Web Usability Guidelines?

Web usability standards serve as a foundation for creating websites that are user-friendly, accessible, and provide a positive experience for the users. These standards ensure that websites are designed with the users in mind and are easy to navigate, understand, and use. By adhering to these standards, websites can attract more visitors, retain them longer, and increase their overall engagement and satisfaction.

> User-friendly, accessible, and provide a positive experience for the users.

There are various legalities behind not using web usability standards. For example, failing to comply with accessibility guidelines such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) can result in legal consequences for businesses and organizations, including lawsuits and fines. Additionally, not providing a user-friendly and accessible website can negatively impact the reputation and brand image of the business, leading to loss of customers and decreased profits.

### Guidelines:

- User-centered Design: Focus on the needs and expectations of the users, make sure the website is user-friendly and easy to navigate.

- Consistency and Standardization: Ensure consistency in the layout, design, and language throughout the website. This helps users to quickly recognize and understand the different elements on the page.

- Accessibility: Make the website accessible for people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, or motor impairments.

- Content Quality: Ensure the website has high-quality, relevant, and accurate content that is well organized and easy to read.

- Speed and Performance: The website should load quickly and perform well, even on slow internet connections.

- Feedback and Error Management: Provide clear and helpful feedback to the users, including error messages, notifications, and progress indicators. This helps users to understand what is happening on the website and avoid frustration.
