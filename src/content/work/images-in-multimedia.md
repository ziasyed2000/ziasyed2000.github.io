## Why are images important in multimedia?

In today's digital age, where attention spans are decreasing and competition is increasing, it is crucial to engage your audience quickly and effectively. One of the most effective ways to do this is by incorporating images and multimedia into your website. Here's why:

- Visual Appeal: Humans are visual creatures and are naturally attracted to things that are visually appealing. The use of images and multimedia can help make your website more visually appealing, which can increase the amount of time visitors spend on your site.

- Increased Engagement: Images and multimedia can also help increase engagement on your website. By incorporating videos, slideshows, or other interactive elements, you can capture the attention of your audience and keep them engaged for longer periods.

- Improved Retention: Research has shown that people remember information better when it is presented in a visual format. By including images and multimedia on your website, you can help visitors better remember the content on your site.

- Improved SEO: Search engines love multimedia content, as it signals that your website is providing valuable and engaging content. Including images and multimedia can help improve your website's search engine rankings.

- Improved Social Media Sharing: Including multimedia content on your website can make it more shareable on social media. This can help increase your website's exposure and bring more traffic to your site.

## Can I make the added media still accessible?

Yes! You can. In addition to the benefits mentioned above, incorporating images and multimedia you also need accomodate for accessibility guidelines. Here's how:

- Alternative Text: When you include images on your website, it's important to add alternative text (alt text) descriptions. Alt text provides a textual description of the image for users who are visually impaired or unable to view the image. This helps to make your content more accessible and ensures that all users can understand the message you are trying to convey.

- Captions and Transcripts: When you include videos or audio files on your website, it's important to provide captions and transcripts. Captions are text overlays that appear on the video screen, while transcripts are text versions of the audio content. Both of these features make it possible for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to understand the content. They can also be useful for users who are not fluent in the language used in the video or audio.

- Assistive Technology: Users who are visually impaired or have other disabilities often rely on assistive technology, such as screen readers or text-to-speech software, to access online content. Including multimedia content on your website makes it possible for users of assistive technology to engage with your content in a meaningful way.
