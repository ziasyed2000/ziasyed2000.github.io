## What is Film Making?
Film making is an art that combines creativity and technical expertise to create a visual story that can captivate and move audiences. It is a multi-step process that requires planning, coordination, and attention to detail. In this blog post, we will go through the different steps of film making and provide two video examples to illustrate each step.

## What are the Film Making Guidelines?
The most popular and useful film making guidelines are as follows:

#### Step 1: Idea
The first step in film making is to come up with an idea for a story or concept that can be turned into a film. This idea can come from anywhere â€“ personal experiences, books, news stories, or even dreams.

#### Step 2: Script
Once the idea is formed, the next step is to write a script that outlines the story, characters, dialogue, and scenes. The script is the blueprint for the film and serves as the guiding force for all other stages of film making.

For Example: A script of a movie.

#### Step 3: Storyboard
The storyboard is a visual representation of the script that breaks down the story into individual shots. It is a way to plan and organize the filming process and helps the director and cinematographer determine how to capture each scene.

#### Step 4: Breakdown Sheet
The breakdown sheet is a detailed list of everything that is needed for each scene, including actors, props, costumes, makeup, and special effects. It helps the production team plan and budget for each scene.

#### Step 5: Setting
The setting of a scene can be external (EXT) or internal (INT). The location of the scene is crucial in creating the right atmosphere and mood for the story.

Video Example: I filmed this short clip showing off a recent visit to the Toronto's Centre Island, showing how a setting can be a major influence.

#### Step 6: Props, Makeup, Costumes, etc.
The props, makeup, costumes, and other visual elements are used to create the look and feel of the film. They can help establish the time period, location, and characters' personalities.

#### Step 7: Principle Photography
Principle photography is the stage where the actual filming takes place. This is where the director, cinematographer, and actors work together to bring the script to life.

#### Step 8: Editing
After the filming is complete, the editing process begins. This involves assembling the clips, adding special effects, music, and sound effects to create the final product.

Video Example: I also shot another similar clip showing off the Trinity Bellwoods Park & it's Cherry Blossom Trees, where editing a film can have major impacts on the look and feel.

In conclusion, film making is a collaborative process that involves many different stages and requires a diverse set of skills. From the initial idea to the final product, every step is crucial in creating a successful film. The videos mentioned above provide excellent examples of the different stages of film making, and how they come together to create a powerful and moving visual story.
